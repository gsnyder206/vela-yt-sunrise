Drizzled TinyTim PSFs created by E. J. McGrath
created 2011-07-24
** updated 2012-07-19
update adds F435W and increases the size of the PSF images to 167x167 (for 
60mas PSFs) and 235x235 (for 30mas PSFs) in order to be consistent with 
the WFC3 PSFs.

These PSFs were created in a similar manner as the CANDELS PSFs but for the
original GOODS-S ACS data.  The naming convention is slightly different 
and the image size is slightly different (some are 99 x 99 pixels instead of
167 x 167).

I am only including the centered PSFs.  The additional number in the filename 
denotes the image size in pixels.
