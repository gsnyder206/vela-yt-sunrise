Hybrid TinyTim + empirical PSFs

created by Y.-Y. Chang using Y. Guo's star-stacking code, modified by 
A. van der Wel and Y.-Y. Chang on 21 Mar 2012, and TinyTim PSF 
created by E. J. McGrath

These PSFs use a combination of the TinyTim simulated PSF and stacked star 
empirical PSFs.  The reason for doing this is that the TinyTim PSFs are 
better in the core region (where centroiding issues tend to broaden empirical
PSFs), while the empirical PSFs appear to fit real stars better in the wings.

PSF consists of the following components:
0   pixels <  radius < 2.5 pixels: tinytim
2.5 pixels <= radius < 40  pixels: stacked star
40  pixels <= radius             : tinytim

Star list used for creating the stacked star portion is included as a .dat 
file.  Columns in the .dat file are RA, Dec, and peak flux.
